My solution for the testing task about an insurance company.

IDE: VS2015 Community

Framework Version: .Net 4.5.2

Time required to solve: Around 8 hours total (including setup and docs).

This implementation currently passes all the tests.

Considerations:
- Can dry up the code.
- Can use pre-conditions for exception throwing.
- Can write more tests to adhere to equivalence classes better.
